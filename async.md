# AsyncAPI document
An AsyncAPI document is a file that defines the key components of an event-driven API. Unlike REST, which is synchronous, this type of API handles asynchronous communication through events. The document uses JSON or plain YAML (with no extensions) to ensure compatibility with JSON-like features.


Here is what AsyncAPI does: after defining your asynchronous or events-based API, the document converts it into readable code; this is done automatically. 
Now, you could use it to generate more documents and validate incoming and outgoing messages. You could also use it to apply policies to your events before they are sent to a broker (not the financial kind, but a message broker).


With that, you can get your machine-readable API documents, which parse and validate messages between the API and your application, amongst other features.
